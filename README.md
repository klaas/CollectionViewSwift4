# CollectionViewSwift4

This is Xcode 9.1 / Swift 4 version of <https://github.com/klaas/CollectionViewElCapitan> from two years ago:

Apple changed the way `NSCollectionView` works in OS 10.11 as shown in the talk ["What's New in NSCollectionView"](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015-225/) at WWDC 2015. They also provide a complex example written in Objective-C: [CocoaSlideCollection](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/CocoaSlideCollection/Introduction/Intro.html)

This is a simple sample project written in Swift.

It uses the standard Cocoa Application template and has a single view controller containing two collection views. One is setup with Interface Builder. The other is coded programmatically. There are also two collection view items. Again, one inside a .xib file the other programmatically. They show simple labels. You can select and double click the items.
